//*********************Advanced User Info*******************************
	//If you want to let your user add a title to their name, like Lady or Master, then you'll want to expand this section a little. This check would go AFTER the check above for a valid name, leading to further choices instead of setting the name. So you'd want to uncomment and put in the else above...
	
	// {
		// "\0\s[0]Do you want a title?\w4\n\n[half]\![*]\q[Nope,titlenone]\n"
		// //You can replace "\0\s[0]Do you want a title?", but don't touch the rest of it.
		// --
		// if presuffix == "masculine" //this value was defined in bootend.dic and menu.dic when the user chose their pronouns. Thus, if someone chose he/him pronouns, they would be able to choose Mr. or Master. If the user hasn't set their pronouns, or that's not a feature of your ghost, you can just put all the choices together without these presuffix checks and let the user decide from all.
		// {
		// "\![*]\q[Mr.,titlemr]\n/
		// \![*]\q[Master,titlemaster]\n"
		// }
		// elseif presuffix == "feminine" //Likewise, if someone chose she/her pronouns, they could choose Ms. or Lady.
		// {
		// "\![*]\q[Ms.,titlems]\n/
		// \![*]\q[Lady,titlelady]\n"
		// }
		// -- //the titles after this are gender neutral and will appear for all users. If you want to remove the masculine and feminine titles entirely, just delete from the curly bracket one line up to the double dashes above "if presuffix == "masculine". That should leave only the neutral titles. Make sure to leave a set of double dashes above the neutral titles though. You can also just put the feminine and masculine titles in here too if you want all titles to be available to all users at all times.
		// "\![*]\q[-ssi,titlessi]\n/
		// \![*]\q[-san,titlesan]\e"
		// //Note that the final line here ends with \e instead of \n/, since it is the final option. Make sure your final option (and ONLY your final option) always ends with \e. More on that in the box below.
	// }
	//Adding new titles for your users to use is simply a matter of copy and pasting creatively. You can see how the ghost puts together the title and your name in the Select. sections below. Above, you simply need to add a new option and link it to a new Select. For example, you could add "\![*]\q[Mistress,titlemistress]\n/" between Ms. and Lady up there, then write up a Select.titlemistress below that fits the pattern of the others.
	//***********************************************************************
	
	//The following Select.title[word] functions add the title to the user's name, then go to the final step, NameDone. You don't have to touch any of these. Advanced users, notice how these match the linked functions in the choices above.
