			-created turning animations for surfaces 0 and 1
			
			- Added intervals 30,31,40,41 with surfaces 3 and 4 to make moving side to side animations
				- in aitalk.dic i am going to make those side to side animations move back and forth randomly
					- right now they are built in peices so i have to stitch them together with the movements or else obie wont be face the direction it is supposed to be moving
						-30 corrisponds with 40 and 31 corrisponds with 41

				- this all is to set up the pos and neg interactions 
		
		-fixed some typos in bootend.dic

		-word.dic changes:
			-removed %(folderdialogue)
				-it was causing problems with overlapping surfaces when being called. 
*NOTE					//-I need to test later whether or not i can use surface changes in word.dic or not
			-moved all green commentary to the bottom so i can refer to it later and so i can find all the different envolopes better
		
		-etc.dic
			-the updates dialouge has been updated. I hope that this wont be annoying for the users updating the ghost with it talking everytime it needs to update something.
