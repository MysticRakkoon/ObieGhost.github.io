If the collision areas for your ghost don't change very much from pose to pose, then you can set them here for multiple surfaces at once and save yourself some time.
//surface.append500-590,205,!507-509 it would do the same, except it would skip Surfaces507 through 509.
//you can have multiple surface.appends as well, if you want to append one set of code to one range of surfaces and another to another. For example, one set of collisions to your main character and one to your side character.
//You can use surface.append to technically apply anything across multiple poses.

		}
//What this does is change the mouse cursor. You can see it's split into mouseup and mousedown, and it uses the names you gave your Collisions up there. 
//You can keep adding unique cursors for all your collisions by sequentially numbering them, like mouseup/down2, mouseup/down3, and so on.
//The system cursors you can use for this are "arrow", "cross", "no", "hand", "grip", "finger", "wait", "text", "move", and "help".

	Head,Hover to pet.
}

//--Surface.alias------------------
//What it does is assign a range of numbers to a single number or word that can be called using \s[].

//this is something i might play around with more later

//sakura.surface.alias
	//{
	//Randomized angry poses
		//randangry,[1505,1506,1507]
	//}

//What this means is that I could then go \s[6666] in dialogue and it would call any of these four Surfaces in the brackets. You can do words as well, like creepy,[1229,1230,1231,1235], and then you could call it with \s[creepy]. This may sound like a convenient shortcut to using words instead of numbers for your ghost's expressions, but I'd probably stick with numbers, really. It just feels like it'd backfire on you eventually.
//You can do the same thing with the side character by using kero instead of sakura.

//kero.surface.alias
//{
//6667,[1228,1232,1233]
//6668,[1228,1232,1233,1234]
//}
//And as you can see, you can have multiple surface aliases set up at any point. In this example, kero has both 6667 and 6668 defined as a range of Surfaces. So \s[6667] would call one of those three Surfaces, and \s[6668] would call one of those four Surfaces.

//---

//Now, if you don't think this is enough Surfaces and want to add more, all you have to do is copy and paste a chunk of Surface code, give it a new number, and then do whatever you want with it. 
//Once you add a new pose, save your surfaces.txt file and reload your shell using the Development Panel Reload option, or by just reloading your ghost entirely via Utilities - Reload Ghost. 
//I always recommend testing your Surfaces, and it's usually pretty easy and simple. If it doesn't look right, tweak surfaces.txt, save, and try again.

		
//*********************More on SERIKO coding*******************************

//--Random things
//You can have random things appear for a little while and then disappear using the random interval. This could be anything from a thought to an expression to a bird to a movement or whatever.

//6interval,random,60 //here the interval is set to random with a value of 60, meaning every 60ms there's a chance this will randomly happen.
//6pattern0,0404,0,overlayfast,0,0
//6pattern1,-1,5000,overlayfast,0,0

//This is much the same as the lines above. You'd replace 0404 with whatever image you'd be using. 5000 is the delay on the frame, so this stays on the screen for about 5 seconds. 
//You can replace that value with whatever you want to change the timing, and change the number after random at the top to adjust how often it might occur.
//Note that at the end the image file number it calls is -1. -1 returns to the base default pose, so you'll want to end most unique or new animations with this to bring your ghost back to normal.

//--Other Animation Options
//There are a few other options you can have for interval animations. We've already seen bind, talk, random, and never so far. 
//Some other ones are always, sometimes, runonce, and rarely. Their names are fairly self-explanatory I'd imagine, but I'll do some really quick examples from my other surfaces.txt files here.

//20interval,always
//20pattern0,182,0,overlay,0,0
//20pattern1,183,0,overlay,0,0
//20pattern2,184,0,overlay,0,0

//This would always run this animation. always intervals only work for animations with more than one frame! If you want to have a single frame that's always present, you'll want to use runonce instead. Otherwise you'll get some annoying shell errors.

//6interval,sometimes
//6pattern0,604,13,replace,0,96
//6pattern1,606,14,replace,0,96
//6pattern2,605,14,replace,0,96
//6pattern3,-1,10,overlay,0,0

//This would run this animation sometimes. Again, note how it ends with on a -1 frame.

//0interval,runonce
//0pattern0,41,13,replace
//0pattern1,42,19,replace

//This would run the animation once and stop on the last frame. You can use this with a single frame to have one image stay in place. 
//This is handy for layering, like if you want to have a head or an arm over other parts of your body. You can set the higher interval for the arm to runonce, then it will stick.

//20interval,rarely
//20pattern0,286,0,base
//20pattern0,288,0,replace,0,0
//20pattern1,287,15,replace,0,0
//20pattern2,-1,25,overlay,0,0

//This would run the animation rarely.

//So you see, fairly straightforward. You can use these animation options to set up other things for your Surface to do. 
//Since I mentioned furries above, you could, say... have a sometimes animation for a tail waving or something. Or a rarely animation for someone coughing, or runonce for someone falling over.


//Interval Stacking
//This is definitely for advanced users, so if you're not interested in the HARD STUFF, you can move on, haha.
//Basically, what you can do with a surface is add a bunch of intervals that are never called (thus the never tag). Then when you are calling the pose with \s, you can add an \i tag with the right number to bring up that interval. 
//What is the actual use of this? This is a perfect way to do eyebrows, for one. You can set up a variety of eyebrows for the same Surface under different intervals, set them all to never, and then just call them in the one pose with \s[0]\i[8] or whatever i number you need. 
//You can also use multiple \i tags to call multiple intervals at the same time to layer effects, like \s[0]\i[5]\i[8]\i[22].

//This example bit of code here is an eyebrow frame set to never.
//8interval,never
//8pattern0,224,0,overlayfast,0,0


//--Stopping Intervals
//This is a huge part of interval stacking above, although you can use it for other things.
//So, I mentioned Hunter's ears. I wanted them to be able to move around with her mood, and I finally figured out a way to do it - I made her base element with no ears, and then set her default ears to "runonce". 
//The problem was, how do I change the ear position if her default ears are always on? Through the use of a SERIKO function called stop, that's how. 
//Basically, I would stop the always default ear interval and start the new one. I'm just going to straight up copy a snip of the code from there into here to look at. 
//See how interval 21 stops 20. You can do the same thing with start instead of stop to start an interval - this can come in handy for stopping and starting different talk animations 
//if you have smiling/serious talk frames in one pose.

//Ears back
//20interval,runonce
//20pattern0,182,0,overlay,0,0

//Ears neutral
//21interval,never
//21pattern0,0,0,stop,20 //the interval it's stopping as at the end, in this case it stops interval 20
//21pattern0,172,0,overlay,0,0

//There are a lot of ways you can use this. 
//For example, in Hunter's battle-ready animation, she'd always be bouncing on her heels normally, but I put in a stop check for her talk interval so she'd stay still and her mouth frames wouldn't get all screwy. 
//Perhaps others can think of other creative ways to use this feature.


//--Layering
//You can think of the intervals in a Surface as layers in a PSD file. The top layers will go on top of the other layers. You can use this to layer certain animations underneath others. 
//If you layer a blink animation below... I dunno, a hair-blowing animation or a sweatdrop or something, the blink should go beneath the other layer and they shouldn't conflict. 
//It's tricky to set-up, so you may need to go through some trial and error.
//As such you should always be mindful of the placement of your layers. Hair layers should go above eye layers, for example.
//This does NOT apply to replace, which does not care about layering and will pre-empt almost all other SERIKO functions like Always or Random. Which sucks. Be careful when using Replace.


//--Base
//Basically, what base does is change the base of your pose from one file to another, which has some limited application, but can come in handy. 
//The best example is from Gordon - He was standing at a three-quarter view with one arm in front of him and one arm behind him. 
//Moving the arm in front of him was easy, it just required layering that arm above all the others. Moving the arm BEHIND him was harder, because his body was the base frame and you can't move things behind that. 
//To get it to work, I would use base to temporarily change the base to his back arm, then change it back after it had moved. To snag a bit of code from his surfaces.txt file...

//Left arm half out
//21interval,never
//21pattern4,0504,0,base,0,0
//21pattern5,-1,800,base,0,0

//Always make sure to set the base back to the original image with -1 at the end. 
//It might be easier to just have the body in a higher layer than your back arms though... but that's just the application I found for this. It might be just what you need for whatever you're doing.


//--Replace
//Alright, here we go. Replace basically does what it says - it replaces the image (or part of the image) with another image. 
//Have you noticed so far that the last two numbers of all the pattern lines have almost always been 0,0? 
//Go ahead, scroll up again and look. Almost always 0,0. That's because if all your images are the same size (and they definitely should be, this is the very reason why you should be doing that)
//they will always line up properly with each other, and you'll almost never have to put anything but 0,0.
//Unless you're using replace.
//Actually that's not entirely true. If you're replacing the ENTIRE image with a new one, then you can leave replace as 0,0. 
//That can be handy for full body animations like... someone getting hit, for example. 
//You could have four unique frames of them falling to the ground, and you'd use replace for each of those frames to change the entire image each time.
//However, most of the time (at least in my experience) you're going to be using replace for smaller things, primarily mouths in profile view I'm going to guess. 
//And if you're going to be doing that, you're going to need to find yourself some coordinates. Do you remember setting up collisions up there? This is much the same thing. 
//First, let's pull up a bit of replace code. I'll use one from Hunter and Smoker as an example. Here's one of Smoker's talking animations where she's in profile. 
//You can see the frames for this on the surfaces.txt page of the walkthrough.

//talking
//1interval,talk,4
//1pattern0,0,0,alternativestart,[2.3.4]

//2interval,never
//2pattern0,708,13,replace,0,72
//2pattern1,-1,10,overlay,0,0

//3interval,never
//3pattern0,709,14,replace,0,72
//3pattern1,-1,10,overlay,0,0

//4interval,never
//4pattern0,709,14,replace,0,72
//4pattern1,708,14,replace,0,72
//4pattern2,-1,10,overlay,0,0

//You'll see at first that it's very similar to the talk function we set up above. However, there is a distinct difference. Overlay has been replaced with replace, and the final number is different. Those two numbers are the x,y coordinates for that image, and tell it where it needs to replace.
//In the interest of making this as simple as possible, and avoiding a problem I ran into when I cropped things too tightly, what you're going to do is go into your image with your profile talk frames. You are going to draw a rectangle that VERTICALLY just about covers your mouth frames, and HORIZONTALLY spans your entire image. Then you'll crop your image down to that rectangle. What this will create is an image that is the same WIDTH as your base image, but a different HEIGHT. Save those images as your mouth frames.
//Since your new mouth frame is the same width as your base image, you can leave it as 0. How do you find the second number then? The second number is the Y value, and it's the top of your rectangle. Undo your crop so your image is its base size again, hold your cursor at the top of your rectangle, and look at the coordinates in Photoshop info or MSPaint or whatever. Write down that Y number, and put it in here. Test your shell and see if the mouth frames line up properly. If they're a pixel too high or low, adjust the number until they line up right.
//You'll notice the last line in each interval, the one with -1 and with the remaining overlay tag, is still set to 0,0. That's because that's the animation returning to normal. You don't have to mess with that line. Just replace the 708 709 whatever numbers in the replace lines with what you're using.

//"But Zar!" you exclaim. "If I go all the way horizontally, then I run into my eye frames, and the blinking animation doesn't look right because replace doesn't care about me!" in which cause ouch, because that sucks and means you're going to have to get a little more into this.
//Alright, this time, draw your same rectangle over your mouth frames. THIS TIME, however, don't stretch it all the way across. Draw it as close to your mouth frames as you can without filling up the entire rectangle. Specifically, leave at least ONE PIXEL blank in the top left corner if you possibly can. If you don't that pixel will flicker during the animation and if you're like me it will slowly drive you insane.
//Once you've drawn your rectangle, take your cursor and find the coordinates again. This time, look for the y coordinate at the top of the rectangle, and x at the left side of it if I remember right. Write them down, come back over here, and fill out the last two numbers of each line as appropriate. Go back to your image, crop it down to your rectangle, and save your mouth frames. Test. Adjust. Repeat until it looks right.
//You can see now why I recommended keeping your mouth frames inside your silhouette as much as you can. If you are running into the blink problem, you can try putting your blink interval above your talk interval. So if your talk intervals are 1-4 for example, you could put blink as 5interval instead. That could fix your problem! Maybe. Surfaces.txt can be annoying.

//As a side note, replace will go over bound items like dress-up items, so keep this in mind if you're making clothes for your ghost. 
//Replace will also take precedent over most other animation methods like Random or Always. For example, if you set up something to always play in the background, like... let's say, a fire was behind your character, and at some point you wanted to use replace on the main body of your character to say, make them move their arm. 
//Replace will then shut off the Always interval and do its own thing, no matter how you layer it. It works okay with Overlay though. Basically, you'll need to mess with it a bit yourself to see when it works and when it doesn't.

//--Move
//The last of the animation functions and one that's really fairly simple. Move just moves the frame around your screen. This is handy when you want to move your character but don't want to draw a ton of frames for it.
//Here's an example from my Hunter and Smoker file. This is when Hunter would get hit in battle. She'd slide backwards a little bit.

//sliding back slightly
//0interval,runonce
//0pattern0,0,15,move,1,0
//0pattern1,0,5,move,2,0
//0pattern2,0,7,move,3,0
//0pattern3,0,10,move,4,0
//0pattern2,0,15,move,5,0

//As you saw above with the replace option, the last two numbers of any line are the x and y values. 
//In this case, Hunter is sliding horizontally across the ground, so I changed the first number, the x. Over the course of five frames, she slides about five pixels back. 
//You can adjust the timing by changing the number before move in each of them.
//You can use this to move your character around wherever you want. 
//Horizontally, vertically, both at the same time, and at any speed you want. If you just set it to one frame with no delay, they'll just teleport over there.
//However, your character will stay where they moved unless you move them back, they go into another pose, or OnSurfaceRestore moves them back I think (see aitalk.dic). 
//So you may want to set up some reverse move frames to bring them back to 0,0.
//One really handy use for move is making things bob up and down (like a thought bubble) without having to draw new frames for it.
