HI!! I am making this ghost mainly for us to use! I may add more to this so more people could add to it besides us, but for now this is for us! 
I am mainly making this for us to keep track of things as we delve into our own personal projects and etc. Please let me know any suggestions you have! 

Features: 
-Can recycle your recycle bin!
-Tell you weird facts
-Remind you to drink water, eat a snack, etc (hopefully you will be able to set the intervals for that in a later update)
-Be trapped inside your computer screen 
-Kiss timer??

Sooner or later I will get the automatic updates figured out as well for this so you can update it and see all the changes and etc that I've added. 


You must download the program SSP to run this. 
Here is the website to download this: https://ssp.shillest.net/ (double click for the link to take you there)

Then click 'complete install package' let it download and install. It is a good idea to keep the program files in documents or a place that is easy to access but away so you dont mess with it much.
When booted the program will open up the default ghost Emily. Make sure to right click, look for the tab called 'language' and make sure it is on english. This won't change the ghosts language but will keep the menu from going into Japanese.
Then drag this .zip / .nar file onto Emily and she'll automatically install Obie. You can also put this entire 'Obie' ghost file in the 'ghost' folder and restart the SSP program.
IT IS EASIER TO JUST INSTALL THE .zip / .nar FILE THOUGH!!! 
Then just right click for the menu, navigate to 'change ghost' and choose Obie!
AND DONE!
