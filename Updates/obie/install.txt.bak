//You should only uncomment this line if you're bundling a balloon with your ghost. 
//Meaning, inside your ghost folder, you have ghost, shell, and your balloon's folder 
//(like z_simple, balloontime, newsreport). If your balloon folder in there, it will 
//install with your ghost. If you do NOT have a balloon included with your ghost, 
//then leave this line commented.
